constant::defer makes subroutines similar to the builtin constant.pm,
but with the value calculation deferred until the sub is actually run.

    use constant::defer FOO => sub { calculate;
                                     return $something };

This is handy for big or slow things only needed sometimes, or where
at least the pain can be put off the point needed.

Lazy or deferred calculations can be hidden behind a scalar variable
too.  The choice between a sub and a variable is a matter of style or
personal preference.  Both ways have advantages, see the
constant::defer POD for some notes.
